<h2>Our Story</h2>
  <h7>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We are a family owned business, so that has always been our main priority. Our grandparents retired down in Cape May after living in the suburbs of New York City for nearly 60 years. People asked them how they kept their mind so sharp, and their answer was "we never stopped reading". That's when they decided to open a book store in the place they always dreamed of retiring, to make sure the rest of the oldies in the town stay as sharp as them. Soon enough people were coming in every week looking for new recommendations and our shop became a household name. Since then our parents took over and now all the grandkids have a shared stake in this place we all call home. You'll notice when (emphasis on when) you visit us that we always have the dogs, kids and rest of our family running around the store. Say hi, hang out for a while, read in the reading nook, and thank you for visiting us. We hope our shop is a place your family can make memories too! 
  This little story is dedicated to our grandparents, Gammy and Papa Jones, we all love and miss you!</h7>
